## Objective
Control the majority of a 3×3 grid by strategically placing pieces and capturing opponent pieces. The game is played over three rounds, and the player who wins the most rounds becomes the Sovereign.

---

## Components
- **Grid**: A 3×3 playing area.
- **Pieces**: Each player has a deck of 7 pieces, chosen from 7 types, each with unique abilities.
- **Markers**: Tokens to indicate control of pieces on the grid (e.g., Player 1 uses black markers, Player 2 uses white markers).

---

## Setup
### Deck Building:
1. **Select Pieces**: Each player builds a deck of 7 pieces, selecting any combination of piece types, following deck restrictions.
2. **Deck Restrictions**:
   - **Mask, Aura, Scepter**: Only one of each is allowed per deck.
   - **Deck Size**: Your deck must contain exactly 7 pieces.
3. **Deck Order**: Players may choose to order their decks or shuffle them before the game begins.

### Markers:
- Each player takes a set of markers to represent control on the grid.

---

## Gameplay Overview
Players take turns placing pieces on the grid, activating abilities, and attempting to control spaces by capturing opponent pieces.

---

## Turn Structure
### 1. Draw Phase:
- Draw the top piece from your deck.

### 2. Placement Phase:
#### Place the Piece:
- Place the piece on any unoccupied space on the grid.
- Choose the orientation of the piece (cannot be changed later).

#### Activate Abilities:
- Immediately resolve any abilities of the placed piece.

### 3. Capturing Phase:
#### Compare Ranks:
- For each orthogonally adjacent opponent piece:
  - Compare your piece's rank with the adjacent side's rank of the opponent's piece.
  - If your rank is higher, you capture the opponent's piece.
  - If equal or lower, no action is taken.

#### Quadrant Bonus Check:
- **Quadrant Control**: Check if you now control all four spaces in any 2×2 quadrant. If so, apply the **Quadrant Bonus** (see Quadrant Bonus Mechanic).

### 4. End of Turn:
- Pass the turn to your opponent.

## Key Concepts
### Capturing
- **Definition**: Capturing a piece means taking control of it. Replace the opponent's marker with your own.
- **Orientation**: The captured piece retains its original orientation and ranks.
- **Abilities**: Abilities of the captured piece do not re-activate upon capture.

### Rank
- **Definition**: The numerical value on each side of a piece, representing its strength on that side.

### Orthogonally Adjacent
- **Definition**: Two spaces are orthogonally adjacent if they are directly next to each other horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

### Order of Operations
1. **Abilities Activate First**: Resolve the placed piece's ability immediately upon placement.
2. **Capturing Resolved Next**: After abilities are resolved, proceed to compare ranks for capturing.

## Quadrant Bonus Mechanic
### Mechanic:

### Duration:
- **Persistent**: The bonus persists as long as you maintain control of all four spaces in the quadrant.

### Impact:

### Determining the Winner:

   - Include any bonuses from Quadrant Bonuses when calculating total ranks.

## Examples of Play

### Example 1: Capturing with Ranks
**Situation**:
- Your piece has a rank of 4 on its right side.
- You place it to the left of an opponent's piece, so your right side is adjacent to their left side, which has a rank of 3.

**Order of Operations**:
- **Abilities Activation**: No abilities to activate.
- **Capturing Phase**: Compare ranks: Your 4 vs. their 3.

**Result**:
- Since 4 > 3, you capture their piece.
- Replace their marker with yours on their piece.
